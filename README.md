Sample Jmeter Groovy Scripts to Process some 'n' Number of Flat Files into your FTP Requests 
Sample Jmeter BeanShell Scripts to Process some 'n' Number of TextFiles into your Requests

If you have the below requirement, the following script will help you.

I have some 'n' number of flat files under a sub directory.

For a FTP Request I have to Process the 'n' number of files under this sub directory one by one and have to pass it into a FTP request using a ForEach Controller.

Also I have illustrated a way to use relative path in Jmeter by pointing to the root directory where the test plan file exists.
